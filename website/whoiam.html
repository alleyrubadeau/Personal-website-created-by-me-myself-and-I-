    <h1>Alley Who?</h1>
      <p>My name is Alley and I am estactic to start G School!  I went to Fort
     Lewis College AKA Fort Leisure in Durango, CO.  I majored in business and
     always thought I wanted to be an accountant.  Turns out I went back to
     school to become a Certified Personal Trainer through National Academy of
     Sports Medicine!  I have been working as a Personal Trainer for the last 2
     years.  To find out more about my personal training career visit my website

    <h1>Why work my brain instead of my body?</h1>
      <p>As much as I love personal training I need more of a challenge.  I presented
       a organization problem to my husband Tristan in my personal training business
       and he created a website for me help me stay organized.  I thought it was the coolest
       thing and now I am hooked!</p>
